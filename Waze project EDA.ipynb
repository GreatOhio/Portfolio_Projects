    "   4.If the missing data are missing completely at random (MCAR), meaning that the reason for missingness is independent of the data values themselves, we can proceed with a complete-case analysis by removing the rows with missing values. Otherwise, we need to investigate the root cause of the missingness and make sure it won't interfere with the statistical inference and modeling."

To help you make the decision, you can start with these general guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Delete them: If I am sure the outliers are mistakes, typos, or errors and the dataset will be used for modeling or machine learning, then I am more likely to decide to delete outliers. Of the three choices, I’ll use this one the least.\n",

However, several variables had highly improbable or perhaps even impossible outlying values, such as `driven_km_drives`. Some of the monthly variables also might be problematic, such as `activity_days` and `driving_days`, because one has a max value of 31 while the other has a max value of 30, indicating that data collection might not have occurred in the same month for both of these variables.*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Did my investigation give rise to further questions that I would like to explore or ask the Waze team about?\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Yes. I'd want to ask the Waze data team to confirm that the monthly variables were collected during the same month, given the fact that some have max values of 30 days while others have 31 days. I'd also want to learn why so many long-time users suddenly started using the app so much in just the last month. Was there anything that changed in the last month that might prompt this kind of behavior?*\n",

On the other hand, number of driving days had a negative correlation with churn. Users who drove more days of the last month were less likely to churn.*\n",
